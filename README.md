Dudes-Dungeons
==============

Dudes&Dungeons are a small 3 man project for Aalborg University Copenhagen - the results of this project will be published here.

In the first coming weeks we will focus on getting some conceptual idea, and also learn how to use Github...

Short update 27/4-2014 :

We have already made some concept design for the game aswell as some basic agreements on how we want the game to work. It is currently planned that wednesday the 3/4-2014, we expect to sit down and get some code overview process' going... Drawing charts (UML/Flow/MindMaps, etc.) that along with a videolog will explain how the implementation will function as well as some sketches of the desired user interface, art style and whatnaught.

So around the 3/4-2014, some commits on wiki with some concepts, sketches and explanations will be made and we will be adding a schedule to top it off.

Basic idea:

Sidescroller dungeoncrawler ActionRPG/Brawler type of game, the outline of the story is that you are a doodle on some paper at some artist's desk, your creator goes missing, and you need to go find him... Throughout the game you will meet some platformer elements in the form of climbing/jumping and strategizing your movements, but we will stick to the action Hack'n'Slash theme so enemies and attacks are a requirement, looting will be implemented in the form of 'corpse harvesting' you can harvest different elements in your enemies and apply it to your own, effectively mutating your doodle body into elements of theirs. (Enemies are also doodles, sketches will be made to explain this further after 3/4-2014.)

Much more to say, so stay tuned for the 3/4-2014.

-Cheers, Dudes&Dungeons, AAU OOP Group.
