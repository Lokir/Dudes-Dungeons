Dudes-Dungeons
==============

Dudes&Dungeons are a small 3 man project for Aalborg University Copenhagen - the results of this project will be published here.

As of 18:00 april 2nd, we started updating the wiki pages, so please go to https://github.com/Lokir/Dudes-Dungeons/wiki for more information.

-Cheers, Dudes&Dungeons, AAU OOP Group.

So now we have come to the end of the road... It's been a rough road, we acknowledge that.
Today it is the 29th of April, it's 19:02, and we finally finished the game and all the code and the comments, and the sounds, and the graphics and well, everything else it contains.

-All code found in this repository is open to the public, textures and sounds are all either creative common, freesound or other sorts of free stuff. And what is not has been editted to a point where it fits our own and is of danish copyright law no longer creditted to the original owners.

None the less we thank these anonymous contributors, we couldn't have done it without you.
There is one exception though, background music is not ours to claim, we know not where it comes from and it is only! a stand-in due to project delivery at the 30'th.

Feel free to reuse assets and code, we do however ask that you tell us and credit us to a bare minimum as:"Inspired by Lokir & Toszi."
