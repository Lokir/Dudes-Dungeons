Dudes-Dungeons
==============

Dudes&Dungeons are a small 3 man project for Aalborg University Copenhagen - the results of this project will be published here.

In the first coming weeks we will focus on getting some conceptual idea, and also learn how to use Github...

As of 18:00 april 2nd, we started updating the wiki pages, so please go to https://github.com/Lokir/Dudes-Dungeons/wiki for more information.

-Cheers, Dudes&Dungeons, AAU OOP Group.
